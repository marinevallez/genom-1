\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were given the objective to build a program with an application in actual
 genomic problems.
 Several inputs can be given by the user, such as a genome sequence, a position-
weight-matrix (PWM), binding scores along a specific sequence ...
 The idea is to offer different outputs that can help the user to solve
 his problem.
 The output can be a list of sites, affinity score for a given sequence,
 a PWM (or a PSSM), or a graphic representation of the PMW (logo showing
 the different nucleotides A, T, C and G at different sizes, among their
 probability).

\begin_layout Section
Download the program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To download the program, go to : https://github.com/EPFL-SV-cpp-projects/genom-1.
 Open a terminal, and type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

git clone : 
\series bold
https://github.com/EPFL-SV-cpp-projects/genom-1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\series default
The genom-1 folder and all its content will be copied in your directory,
 you can then compile and execute the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Compilation and execution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compile and execute the program, a fews steps are required.
 Make sure you are in the genom-1 folder and then :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
rm â€“rf build 
\series default
and
\series bold
 mkdir build
\series default
 to make sure an empty build folder is crated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
cmake../ 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
make
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then you have several options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to see the documentation with the doxyfile, describing more
 precisely the different classes and fonctions involved in the program you
 will then have to write 
\series bold
make doc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to execute the program, then do 
\series bold
../src/Main
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to run the tests of the program, then do 
\series bold
make test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The functionalities of the program 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you execute the program, a menu will appear, proposing you a list of
 outputs designed by their numbers.
 You can choose the task the program must do by hitting '1', '2' or '3'
 or '4'.
 Then you will be asked to provide the inputs (if the program needs a file
 you can write its name like "
\begin_inset Formula $example.fasta$
\end_inset

").
 Here are the mains functionalities of the program :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.- Being able to read a DNA sequence and a PWM (or/and it's logarithmic
 version) and give as output the list of site along the genome where the
 protein is gonna attach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.- Being able to read a DNA sequence, a list of sites and their respective
 binding score (the product of the probabilities of each nucleotide along
 the sequence) and output a PWM (or/and it's logarithmic version).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.- Based on the matrix or based on the binding scores and list of sites,
 being able produce a sequence logo.
